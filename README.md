# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulation
This project is a CPU scheduling algorithm simulation that allows users to set the parameters using a graphical user interface (GUI). The algorithm uses various scheduling techniques such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF) and Round Robin (RR).
